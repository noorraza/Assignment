/*There are 3 student processes and 1 teacher process. Students are supposed to do their
assignments and they need 3 things for that pen, paper and question paper. The teacher
has an infinite supply of all the three things. One students has pen,an other has paper and
another has question paper. The teacher places two things on a shared table and the
student having the third complementary thing makes the assignment and tells the teacher
on completion. The teacher then places another two things out of the three and again the
student having the third thing makes the assignment and tells the teacher on completion.
This cycle continues. WAP to synchronize the teacher and the students.*/
